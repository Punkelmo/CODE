    "In this guided project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. You can find the DETE exit survey data here. The original TAFE exit survey data is no longer available. We've made some slight modifications to the original datasets to make them easier to work with, including changing the encoding to UTF-8 (the original ones are encoded using cp1252.)"
